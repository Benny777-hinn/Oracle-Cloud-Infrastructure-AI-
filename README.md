This workflow covers the essential steps of a supervised machine learning process: data preparation, model training, and prediction.


1.Import Libraries: Loads pandas for data handling and scikit-learn's LogisticRegression for modeling.

2.Create Dataset: Defines a small sample dataset with iris flower measurements and species, then converts it to a pandas DataFrame.

3.Save and Display Data: Saves the dataset to a CSV file and displays it in the notebook.

4.Prepare Features and Labels: Splits the data into features (SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth) and labels (Species).

5.View Features: Shows the first few rows of the features for inspection.

6.Create Model: Initializes a logistic regression model.

7.Train Model: Fits the model to the features and labels.

8.Predict: Uses the trained model to predict the species of new iris samples based on their measurements.

9.Show Predictions: Prints the predicted species.

This file consists of  how Classification with Multiplayer Perceptron
and this file shows its small demo how it works 
where it tells how 
the input layer, hidden Layer , output Layer work 

1.Import Libraries

numpy for numerical operations.
matplotlib.pyplot for plotting.
make_circles to generate synthetic data.
MLPClassifier for building a neural network classifier.
ipywidgets and interactive for creating interactive widgets in the notebook.
display to show widgets.

2.Define the Interactive Plot Function

def update_plot(hidden_layer_size):
This function will be called whenever the slider value changes.

3.Generate Data

X, y = make_circles(n_samples=300, noise=0.1, factor=0.5, random_state=0)
Generates a new dataset each time the function runs.

4.Train the Neural Network

clf = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(hidden_layer_size), activation='relu', max_iter=3000, random_state=1)
Creates a neural network with a single hidden layer of size specified by the slider.
clf.fit(X, y)
Trains the model on the generated data.

5.Create a Grid for Decision Boundary Visualization

x_vals and y_vals are ranges covering the feature space.
X_plane, Y_plane = np.meshgrid(x_vals, y_vals)
Creates a grid of points for plotting.
grid_points = np.column_stack((X_plane.ravel(), Y_plane.ravel()))
Flattens the grid for prediction.

6.Predict on the Grid and Training Data

Z = clf.predict(grid_points)
Predicts class labels for each grid point.
Z = Z.reshape(X_plane.shape)
Reshapes predictions to match the grid.
y_pred = clf.predict(X)
Predicts class labels for the training data.

7.Plot the Decision Boundary and Data Points

plt.clf()
Clears the previous plot.
plt.contour(...)
Plots the decision boundary.
class_0 = y_pred == 0
Boolean mask for class 0.
class_1 = y_pred == 1
Boolean mask for class 1.
plt.scatter(...)
Plots the data points, colored by predicted class.
Axis labels, title, legend, and display.

8.Create and Display the Interactive Slider

hidden_layer_size_slider = widgets.IntSlider(...)
Slider to select hidden layer size.
interactive_plot = interactive(update_plot, hidden_layer_size=hidden_layer_size_slider)
Links the slider to the function.
display(interactive_plot)
Shows the interactive widget.

Summary:
This code lets you interactively change the size of the hidden layer in a neural network and see how the decision boundary and predictions change for the synthetic circles dataset. It helps visualize how neural network complexity affects classification.
