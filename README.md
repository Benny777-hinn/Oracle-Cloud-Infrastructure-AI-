This workflow covers the essential steps of a supervised machine learning process: data preparation, model training, and prediction.


1.Import Libraries: Loads pandas for data handling and scikit-learn's LogisticRegression for modeling.

2.Create Dataset: Defines a small sample dataset with iris flower measurements and species, then converts it to a pandas DataFrame.

3.Save and Display Data: Saves the dataset to a CSV file and displays it in the notebook.

4.Prepare Features and Labels: Splits the data into features (SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth) and labels (Species).

5.View Features: Shows the first few rows of the features for inspection.

6.Create Model: Initializes a logistic regression model.

7.Train Model: Fits the model to the features and labels.

8.Predict: Uses the trained model to predict the species of new iris samples based on their measurements.

9.Show Predictions: Prints the predicted species.
